          <p>
            SyncSense is our “music supervisor agent” that locks emotion, score, and picture into a single controllable
            loop. Starting from a creative brief, we extract a time-varying valence/arousal curve plus descriptive tags,
            then force every downstream decision—music selection, harmonic evolution, visual pacing, and editorial beats—to
            respect that trajectory. The result is AI-generated footage that actually feels right instead of just looking
            slick.

          <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Sound is half of cinema. A good temp track can unlock story beats the picture alone can't. Today's AI video tools 
            don't make that sonic alignment simple or repeatable. SyncSense upgrades AI video from "cool" to compelling, and it's 
            built for creators who don't have a music supervisor or a giant budget. The A/B comparisons are instant "oh wow" moments 
            perfect for social platforms.
          </p>

          <h2>Pipeline at a Glance</h2>
          <p>
            The system runs as five deterministic stages: a prompt or beat sheet becomes the emotion curve; we branch into
            original cue generation or metadata-aligned retrieval; Leonardo and Canvas handle motif-driven visuals locked to
            the musical grid; then we ship synchronized masters plus A/B variants that highlight the impact of the right vs
            wrong score.
          </p>

          <h2>Powered by Leonardo</h2>
          <p>
            Leonardo isn't just another tool in the pipeline—it's the visual foundation that makes emotion-driven generation 
            possible. Its unique capabilities enable rapid iteration, stylistic consistency, and precise control over the visual 
            language that complements our musical architecture.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Rapid Look Development:</strong> Generate cohesive visual palettes, recurring motifs, and style consistency 
              across all shots in minutes instead of days.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Canvas Compositing:</strong> In-paint and out-paint capabilities allow frame-perfect composites aligned to 
              the musical beat grid for synchronized storytelling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Professional Finishing:</strong> Alchemy and Upscale features deliver clean, broadcast-ready finals optimized 
              for both editorial workflows and social distribution.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Iterative Testing:</strong> Batch render scene plates to quickly test multiple emotional curves, allowing 
              rapid creative exploration and refinement.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Six-Week Execution Plan</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Week 1:</strong> Treatment, emotion taxonomy, and style bible creation. Stand up website MVP skeleton 
            (auth, upload, job management) mirroring pipeline contracts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Week 2:</strong> Prototype v1 (prompt → emotion curve → temp score); Leonardo look-dev and asset generation. 
            Wire website to prototype: submit job, queue, return artifacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Week 3:</strong> Produce Clip A with first A/B comparisons. Add provenance view (seeds, tool versions) and 
            GPU queue status to website.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Week 4:</strong> Complete Clips B & C; music-swap testing and stakeholder review. Behind-the-scenes LinkedIn 
            post and newsletter for in-process build.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Week 5:</strong> Final edit, color grading, audio mix/master; process-film shoot and assembly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Week 6:</strong> Export deliverables; caption creation; finalize Prompt Atlas (PDF); produce 4–6 vertical 
            social teasers; micro-premiere. Newsletter and LinkedIn release with Leonardo link and in-depth mechanics. Open 
            website to public.
          </p>
